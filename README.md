**Note** Since Kaggle user [@SRK](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/) has collected all the winning solutions and posted on this [thread](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/winning-solutions-of-kaggle-competitions) already. I decide to archive the repository. Thanks to SRK!
### This repo contains some public code kaggle competition solutions

The purpose of this repo is to learn from the top playes in data science. Personally, I learnt a lot about ensemble techniques
from their discussion threads and the public code. Also HSE of Russia has opend a specialization of courses about machine learning
and data science competition on Coursera. 

Currently, it ~~only~~ contains the ~~solution~~ solutions for the google speech recognition challenge from Heng CherKeng, 
You can have a look at their discussions on (Kaggle)[https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/discussion/)
and amazon planet challenge from [olix20's](https://medium.com/@mdoliya) [repo](https://github.com/olix20/kaggle-planet).
.Please tell me to delete the repo if it has violated your Intellectual Property. Thanks!
